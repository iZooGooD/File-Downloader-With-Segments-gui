# File-Downloader-With-Segments-gui
A simple file downloader using modules urllib,tkinter ,thread in python
The program simply reads binary data using urllib package and also allows us to specify the buffer_size to read at a time,it can download large files you only need to decide the number of segments to access at a time, increasing buffer_size makes the download slow so make sure to use proper segments.
